# 15-112 Project: Password Protection System

This is an edited version of my final semester project for 15-112 Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. [This
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNkPA50DM9E) explains what
the project was about and what I did. Only preinstalled modules in Python were used. To run the program, all python files in this folder must be installed.

## Status

The code is a mess, but I did learn a lot from working on this project. Perhaps, Iâ€™ll try a more mature implementation of this sort of program in the future!
