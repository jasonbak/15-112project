# 15-112 Project: Password Security Proof of Concept [Apr 2016] (Python)

PasswordProtect was my 15-112 Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science term project. I had full control over whatever the heck I want to do, so I wanted to give machine learning a shotâ€“the name initially piqued my interest. 

A self-written feature vector recognizer to identify character glyphs drawn by users in Tkinter. Glyph-recognition algorithm based on the Greedy Point Match technique developed by Steven Stanek and Woodley Packard of UC Berkeley.

the project was about and what I did. 

To run the program, all python files in this folder must be installed. Only preinstalled modules in Python were used.
